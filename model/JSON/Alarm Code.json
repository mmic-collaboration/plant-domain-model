    "description": "Alarm codes are defined by CPI as part of the Digital Membership Architecture for Medicines Manufacturing.  They describe the different failure conditions that can occur during medicines manufacturing process, their relative severity (or 'colour'), and the required recovery action.\n\nAlarm codes have been consolidated from a number of sources, including equipment manufacturers.  It is envisaged that this list will continue to evolve as the requirements are better understood.\n\nThe full list of Digital Membership Alarm Codes is currently defined in the PLANT Domain reference data:\n- https://github.com/mmic-collaboration/plant-domain-model/tree/development/reference-data",
